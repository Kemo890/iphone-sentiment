# Flipkart iPhone SE Sentiment Analysis

In this project I will be taking a look at this Apple iPhone SE review and ratings dataset and doing a sentiment analysis on the data.
I am looking to gain insight on the overall customer sentiment of the iPhone SE and the keywords for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.

The data I used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/apple-iphone-se-reviews-ratings) and it is user ratings of the Apple iPhone SE from the website [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/apple-iphone-se-black-128-gb/product-reviews/itma9285ccc6af28?pid=MOBFWQ6BHUEVZPXD).

If this were real data Apple could use this review data to gain valuable insight on the iPhone and answer questions like:
- What are the customers sentiment towards the iPhone SE?
- What features are mentioned in comments with positive sentiment?
- What features are mentioned in comments with negative sentiment?
